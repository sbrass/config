* Autostart

  I recommend to autostart programs by using systemd's user services.
  The systemd unit files are stored under =.config/systemd/user=.

  When the units are enabled by =systemctl enable --user service-name=, they get started after user login.
  
** =redshift-gtk=

   Redshift provides two unit files =/usr/lib/systemd/user/redshift.service= and =/usr/lib/systemd/user/redshift-gtk.service=.
   I use the GTK version which launches with an icon in the tray.

** =emacs.service=

   I heavily use Emacs. Reducing the relativly long startup time of Emacs I use an emacsclient with an emacs daemon as systemd service.

** =dropbox.service=

   Dropbox should only be started as user. The service is provided by Dropbox itself.

** Others

   All other programs are started by =i3-wm= (see i3/config.base).

   - =nm-applet=
   - =feh= for the wallpaper
   - =unclutter= for hiding the unused mouse (most important for watching videos)
   - =xset= for activating DPMS
   - =xautolock= loading =i3lock-fancy= as screen locker
   - =dunst= as dbus messenger
